process: A module to run child-processes in python with better control
than is available in the subprocess module alone.

Offers sanity checking of what will be run via Program(strict=True),
timeout checking of a running process via TimeoutProcess(), and the 
ability to run a callback periodically that will kill the process if
if fails via CallbackProcess().

This started as being designed for use in larger programs that need
to be sure no child-process will block indefinitely and using SIGALRM
isn't easy because the process is threaded. It evolved to grow a 
callback feature that is used, for example, to check the progress of
a long and slow FTP (if the file hasn't grown in the last hour, kill
the FTP and try again later).

Tests? We don't need to stinkin' tests!

Actually, we probably do
